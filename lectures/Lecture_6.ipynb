    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing the theme of last lecture, let's look at one of the most common tasks in statistical inference: **fitting a line to data**. We won't always fit a straight line, but they are prevalent in astronomy since we're potentially examining data over several orders of magnitude. Hence power-law relationships ($y\\propto x^\\alpha$) become linear relationships in log-log space ($\\ln y \\propto \\alpha\\ln x + \\mathrm{constant}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the noise/scatter in our measurements (the residuals) is generated by a Gaussian process, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = a x_i + b + r_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_i$ is drawn from $N(0, \\sigma)$. Here, $\\sigma$ is the measurement uncertainty, which we take to be the same for all points. The data model includes a linear relationship with two parameters $a,b$: hence the model is written as $M(a,b)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us compute the likelihood. First, we ask ourselves what is the probability $p(y_i|x_i, M(a, b), \\sigma)$ that a particular point $y_i$ would be measured. It is just the normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(y_i|x_i, M(a, b), \\sigma) = N(y_i - M(x)|\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} \\exp \\left( - \\frac{(y_i - M(x_i))^2}{2 \\sigma^2} \\right). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood for all data points is given by the product over $N$ of these terms. Given our previous definitions we can then write down the $\\ln L$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\ln L(a, b) = \\mathrm{constant} - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{(y_i - M(x_i))^2}{\\sigma^2} = \\mathrm{constant} - \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the expression that we now ***maximize*** with respect to $a$ and $b$ to find ML estimators for those parameters. This is equivalent to ***minimizing*** the sum of the squares (the $\\chi^2$) in a *least-squares method*."
