    "\n",
    "**Jeffreys** proposed a scale for interpreting the odds ratio, where $O_{21} > 10$ represents *“strong”* evidence in favor of $M_2$ ($M_2$  is ten times more probable than $M_1$), and $O_{21} > 100$ is *“decisive”* evidence ($M_2$ is one hundred  times more probable than $M_1$). When $O_{21} < 3$, the evidence is *“not worth more than a bare mention.”*\n",

    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "But note:\n",
    "  * These are just **definitions of conventions**, i.e., a way to give a quantitative meaning to qualitative phrases.\n",
    "  * The odds ratio **compares** the models, it doesn't tell us about the *absolute* goodness of fit: model A can be 100x better than model B, but still be pretty lousy.\n",
    "  * Remember: \"***GIGO***\" ***= Garbage In, Garbage Out***. If we use our powerful statistics to rank a bunch of lousy models, that's our fault."
