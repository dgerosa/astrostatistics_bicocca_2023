    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn strives to have a uniform interface (API) across all methods, and we'll see examples of these below. Given a scikit-learn ***estimator*** object named `model`, the following methods are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Available in **all Estimators**\n",
    "     - `model.fit()`: fit training data. For supervised learning applications, this accepts two arguments: the data `X` and the labels `y` [e.g., `model.fit(X, y)`].  For unsupervised learning applications, this accepts only a single argument, the data `X` [e.g., `model.fit(X)`].\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Available in **supervised estimators**\n",
    "    - `model.predict()`: given a trained model, predict the label of a new set of data. This method accepts one argument, the new data `X_new` [e.g., `model.predict(X_new)`], and returns the learned label for each object in the array.\n",
    "    - `model.predict_proba()`: For classification problems, some estimators also provide this method, which returns the probability that a new observation has each categorical label. In this case, the label with the highest probability is returned by `model.predict()`.\n",
    "    - `model.score()`: For classification or regression problems, most (all?) estimators implement a score method.  Scores are between 0 and 1, with a larger score indicating a better fit.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Available in **unsupervised estimators**\n",
    "    - `model.transform()`: given an unsupervised model, transform new data into the new basis. This also accepts one argument `X_new`, and returns the new representation of the data based on the unsupervised model.\n",
    "    - `model.fit_transform()`: some estimators implement this method, which more efficiently performs a fit and a transform on the same input data."
