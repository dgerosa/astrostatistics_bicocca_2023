    "- The manuscript \n",
    "was published posthumously in 1763 and gave rise to the name Bayesian statistics. \n",
    "- **Laplace** rediscovered the Bayesian approach a decade after it was originally published, and greatly clarified some principles.  \n",
    "- Howevever, Bayesian statistics did not find its ways into mainstream science until well into the 20th century, and widespread usage has been hindered until the 1990s with the advent of cheap computing that can map out the Bayesian probability distributions.\n",

    "## Bayesian priors: What Are They & How Do I Choose Them? <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"two\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Priors can be **informative** or **uninformative**.  As it sounds, informative priors are based on existing information (including previously obtained data, but not the data considered right now) that might be available.  Uniformative priors can be thought of as \"default\" priors, i.e., what your prior is when you never used\n",
    "any data, e.g, a \"flat\" prior like $p(\\theta|M,I) \\propto {\\rm C}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed discussion can be found in Section 5.2 in the textbook. In general, we want our inferences to be ***data dominated*** rather than prior dominated, so we try to use ***weakly-informative priors***. There are three\n",
    "main principles used to choose a prior: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (i) The Principle of Indifference\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially this means adopting a uniform prior, though you have to be a bit careful.  Saying that an asteroid is equally likely to hit anywhere on the Earth is not the same as saying that all latitudes of impact are equally likely.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming $1/6$ for a six-side die, or $1/2$ for heads and tails of a fair coin, would be an example of indifference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (ii) The Principle of Invariance (or Consistency)\n",
    "\n",
    "This applies to location and scale invariance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Location invariance** suggests a uniform prior, within the accepted bounds: $p(\\theta|I) \\propto 1/(\\theta_{max}-\\theta_{min})$ for $\\theta_{min} \\le \\theta \\le \\theta_{max}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Scale invariance** gives us priors that look like $p(\\theta|I) \\propto 1/\\theta$, which implies a uniform\n",
    "prior for ln($\\theta$), i.e. a prior that gives equal weight over many orders of magnitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "### (iii) The Principle of Maximum Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not discuss it here - for more details, see Section 5.2.2 in the textbook.\n",
    " \n",
    "It is often true that Bayesian analysis and traditional MLE are essentially equivalent.  \n",
    "However, in some cases, considering the priors can have significant consequences, as\n",
    "we will see later. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will skip examples of very steep priors and their consequences called in astronomy\n",
    "literature **Eddington-Malmquist** and **Lutz-Kelker** biases (see Chapter 5 in the textbook\n",
    "if you are interested). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conjugate Priors\n",
    "\n",
    "In special combinations of priors and likelihood functions, the resulting posterior probability distribution is from the same function family as the prior. These priors are called **conjugate priors** and give a convenient way for generalizing computations. There are exhaustive tables [here](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Conjugate_prior#/Table_of_conjugate_distributions). \n",
    "\n",
    "**EXAMPLE**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the likelihood is Gaussian and the prior function is Gaussian, then so too is the posterior distribution! So the conjugate prior for a Gaussian likelihood is a Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data drawn from a Gaussian likelihood equal to $\\mathcal{N}(\\bar{x},s)$ (where $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean and $s$ is the sample standard deviation), with a prior on the underlying parameters $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_p,\\sigma_p)$, the posterior is $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu^0,\\sigma^0)$, where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu^0 = \\frac{\\mu_p/\\sigma_p^2 + \\bar{x}/s^2}{1/\\sigma_p^2 + 1/s^2},\\quad \\sigma^0 = \\left( 1/\\sigma_p^2 + 1/s^2 \\right)^{-1/2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchical Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "You may hear of ***hierarchical Bayesian modeling*** a great deal these days. It's become sort of a buzz-term for people wanting to sound fancy, and [I am not immune to this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08365). \n",
    "\n",
    "But there's nothing terribly fancy about it. Essentially, we will look at employing prior distributions today that have fixed shapes (e.g. Gaussian distributions centered around fixed values with fixed widths). \n",
    "\n",
    "But in hierarchical Bayesian modeling, the parameters of the prior distribution (called ***hyperparameters***) become part of the search! The data informs not only properties of individual events but also the shape of the prior. Those prior parameters then get their own priors, called ***hyperpriors***. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The whole analysis is then hierarchical, corresponding to multiple layers of inference.** \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we have lots of [exoplanet discoveries](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/discovery/discoveries-dashboard/). \n",
    "- Each of those discoveries started with some lightcurve data, where we fit a likelihood model to that data to deduce parameters of the system. \n",
    "- The prior on those parameters was likely weakly informative. \n",
    "- ***BUT*** the prior is really describing the underlying distribution of orbital periods, eccentricies, etc. So we can use our data not only to inform the properties of each system, but to map out the demographic distribution of exoplanet periods and more! Pretty cool! (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3020)"
