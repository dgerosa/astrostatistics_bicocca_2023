    "$x_i$ is a single measurement with $i=1,...,N$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\{x_i\\}$ refers to the set of all N measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "We are generally trying to *estimate* $h(x)$, the *true* distribution from which the values of $x$ are drawn. We will refer to $h(x)$ as the probability density (distribution) function or the \"pdf\" and $h(x)dx$ is the propobability of a value lying between $x$ and $x+dx$. \n",
    "\n",
    "While $h(x)$ is the \"true\" pdf (or **population** pdf).  What we *measure* from the data is the **empirical** pdf, which is denoted $f(x)$.  So, $f(x)$ is a *model* of $h(x)$.  In principle, with infinite data $f(x) \\rightarrow h(x)$, but in reality measurement errors keep this from being strictly true.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are attempting to guess a *model* for $h(x)$, then the process is *parametric*.  With a model solution we can generate new data that should mimic what we measure.  If we are not attempting to guess a model, then the process is *nonparametic*.  That is we are just trying to describe the data that we see in the most compact manner that we can, but we are not trying to produce mock data."
