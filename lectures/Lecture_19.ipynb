    "Several weeks ago we looked at density estimation and clustering, which are **unsupervised** forms of classification. Let's now look at **supervised** classification. This is where we actually know the \"truth\" for some of our objects and can use that information to help guide the classification of unknown objects.\n",

    "## Generative vs. Discriminative Classification <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"one\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk about two different types of classification where each has a slightly different approach.  As an example, if you are trying to determine whether your neighbor is speaking Spanish or Portuguese, you could 1) learn both Spanish and Portuguese so that you'd know exactly what they are saying or 2) learn the keys rules about the differences between the languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we find ourselves asking which category is most likely to generate the observed result, then we are using using **density estimation** for classification and this is referred to as **generative classification**. Here we have a full model of the density for each class or we have a model which describes how data could be generated from each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- But if we don't care about the full distribution, then we are doing something more like clustering, where we don't need to map the distribution, we just need to define *boundaries*.  Classification that finds the **decision boundary** that separates classes is called **discriminative classification**.  For high-dimensional data, this may be a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the figure below, to classify a new object with $x=1$, it would suffice to know that either \n",
    "1. model 1 is a better fit than model 2 (***generative classification***), or \n",
    "2. that the decision boundary is at $x=1.4$ (***discriminative classification***).\n",

    "### Assessing Your Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Before even introducing different schemes, let's talk about how we define the success of our classification. We'll bring back some concepts from the start of the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first consider **binary classification** where each observation is assigned to either **class=+1** or **class=-1** (or 0 depending on your preference). Let's ignore for now the fact that each observation can be assigned a probability of belonging to class 1 or -1 and we'll only allow those two possibilities (e.g., in the figure above $x=2$ is class +1 and $x=-0.5$ is class -1). \n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, there are 2 types of errors (where our goal is to identify class +1 objects):\n",
    "* a **[False Positive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives#False_positive_error)**, where we have assigned a *true* class label when it is really false. ---> ***Type-1 error***.\n",
    "* a **[False Negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives#False_positive_error)**, where we have assigned a *false* class label when it is really true. ---> ***Type-II error***.\n",
    "\n",
    "All 4 [possibilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity) are (if you want apples [$g_2$], but not oranges [$g_1$]):\n",
    "- **True Positive** = ***correctly identified***  (apple identified as apple)\n",
    "- **True Negative** = ***correctly rejected***  (orange rejected as orange)\n",
    "- **False Positive** = ***incorrectly identified***  (orange identified as apple)\n",
    "- **False Negative** = ***incorrectly rejected***  (apple rejected as orange)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these, we usually define either of the following pairs of terms.  Which is used is largely a matter of preference in different fields, but we'll see that there are some key differences.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Best\" performance is subjective; we trade contamination versus completeness depending on the science. Before we even talk about different classification schemes, let's first talk about how we can quantify which of the methods is \"best\".  (N.B.  We have skipped ahead to Ivezic $\\S$ 9.9).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We do this with a [**Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) curve. **A ROC curve simply plots the true-positive vs. the false-positive rate.** \n",
    "\n",
    "One concern about ROC curves is that they are sensitive to the relative sample sizes. As we already demonstrated above, **if there are many more background events than source events, small false positive results can dominate a signal.** For these cases ***we can plot completeness versus efficiency (1 - contamination).***\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a comparison of the two types of plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Ivezic, Figure 9.17](http://www.astroml.org/_images/fig_ROC_curve_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see that to get higher completeness, you could actually suffer significantly in terms of efficiency, but your FPR might not go up that much if there are lots of true negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you ***choose*** the completeness and efficiency that you want by choosing a **threshold (decision boundary)**. The curves show you what your possible choices are (depending on where you set the threshold). Generally, you want to chose a decision boundary that maximizes the area under the ROC curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the code that makes these plots.  We'll talk about the data that goes into it in a bit.  For now, we'll concentrate on how to generate the ROC and completeness-contamination plots. We'll be comparing 7 different classifiers (with a generic `clf` object), making training and test sets with `split_samples`, then using these tools to generate our plots:\n",

    "**NOTE:** We can take this to the extreme by having one mixture component at each training point. We also don't have to restrict ourselves to a Gaussian kernel, we can use any kernel that we like. The resulting ***non-parametric*** Bayes classifier is referred to as **Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA)**. \n",

    "If we did KDA with a variable bandwidth that depended only on the distance of the nearest neighbor, then we'd have what we call a **Nearest-Neighbor** classifier. Here if $x$ is close to $x'$, then $p(y|x) \\approx p(y|x')$, i.e. **we use the class label of the nearest point**. Note that we have not assumed anything about the conditional density distribution, so it is completely non-parametric.\n",
