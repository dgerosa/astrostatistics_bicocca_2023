    "Inferring the pdf of a sample of data is known as ***density estimation***. Essentially we are smoothing the data to correct for the finiteness of our sample and to better recover the underlying distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density estimation is useful because:\n",
    "- identifying low probability regions can help uncover rare sources. \n",

    "#### How do we determine the optimal kernel bandwidth?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we first discussed histograms and KDE we talked about theoretical computation of optimal bandwidths.  Let's now look at how we can empirically determine the optimal bandwidth through [cross validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid fooling ourselves into thinking our model is better than it is, we set aside some of the data as the \"***test***\" set--that provides an independent check on the the fit from the ***training data***. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's fine if our model has no parameters, or has parameters that are all fixed ahead of time.  But what if we want to try to use the data to not only fit a model, but decide what the best model parameters are?  In that case, we need to set aside some of the training data as a \"***validation***\" set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, not only does that leave us even less data for training, but it also means that it matters which objects are in each of the training, validation, and test sets.  We can solve both of these problems with **cross validation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our KDE example, we are just trying to map the density, not predict the value, so we really only need two sets: training and validation. There are a number of different ways to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You could **randomly sample** to decide which data goes into the training or test sets. We don't just do this once, but rather many times so that each data point is treated both as a training point and as a test point at some stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We could do this in a more ordered way (e.g., to make sure that each object gets sampled as training/test the same number of times) and do a **$K$-fold cross validation**. Here $K$ is the number of \"experiments\" that need to be done so that each data point appears in a test sample once.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We can take $K$-fold cross validation to the extreme by having $K\\equiv N$, so that in each experiment we leave out just one object. This is called **\"Leave-One-Out\" cross validation**.\n",

In a [**mixture model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model) we don't use a kernel for each data point, but rather we fit for the ***locations of the kernels*** in addition to the width. So a mixture model is sort of a hybrid between a tradtional (fixed bin location/size) histogram and KDE. \n",

    "### Mean-shift Clustering <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"twob\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean-shift clustering** works by finding the modes in a kernel density estimator of the distribution. Clustering is achieved by the ***mean-shift algorithm***:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The KDE of the dataset is computed.\n",
    "2. This allows the gradient of the distribution to be calculated. Easy to do since it's a bunch of overlapping Gaussians.\n",
    "3. Each data point is shifted in the direction of increasing gradient, which drives the points toward the modes. \n",
    "4. This process is iterated until all points have converged with clusters of other points at each of several distinct modes.\n",
    "5. Each data point is then associated with a cluster of other points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try this using the same dataset as in $K$-means."

    "One of the most prominent is the **two-point correlation function** which characterizes the excess probability of finding pairs of points at varying separations when compared to a random distribution. It can be described in terms of the power spectrum of fluctuations, $P(k)$ where $k=2\\pi/\\lambda$ and $\\lambda$ is the scale/wavelength of the fluctuation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\xi(r) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2}\\int dk\\, k^2 P(k)\\frac{\\sin(kr)}{kr}.$$\n",

Angular correlation functions are often used because we care about *projected structure* on different scales, rather than depth clustering, e.g., in the CMB this kind of angular clustering is indicative of fluctuations in the primordial density field that can unveil the composition of the Universe at the time of last scattering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher $n$-point correlation functions can be computed (see the image above), but the two-point function is the most common. Why? When dealing with large populations of sources spread across the Universe, we can often invoke the central limit theorem to describe the statistical distribution of sources-- hence **correlations can be approximated as obeying Gaussian statistics, which are entirely defined by the mean and two-point correlators (i.e. the variance)**."
