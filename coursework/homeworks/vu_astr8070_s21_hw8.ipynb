    "## Only one problem this week\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is mostly about generative classification, but will include one discriminative classifer that we'll meet in `Lecture_20`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the following code snippet to read in SDSS galaxy color data.\n",
    "```\n",
    "from astroML.datasets import fetch_sdss_galaxy_colors\n",
    "data = fetch_sdss_galaxy_colors()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is a structured numpy array. Find and print all of the column names. Using the data, create arrays of $(u-g)$, $(g-r)$, $(r-i)$, and $(i-z)$ colors. Also create arrays of redshift and the spectral class. How many regular galaxies and how many quasars are in this sample?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make a scatter plot of $(u-g)$ versus $(g-r)$, color coding by galaxy or quasar class. The plot should include appropriate axis labels and a legend. Set `xlim` between -0.5 and 2.5, and `ylim` between -0.5 and 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stack all colors and the redshift into a data matrix, $X$. Create a target label array that has $0$ for a regular galaxy and $1$ for a quasar. Perform a train-test split, taking $20\\%$ of the data for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a compact `for` loop that iterates over the fitting of a Gaussian Naive Bayes classification algorithm to successively more features of the data. Within the loop, compute and plot an ROC curve. The end result should be a plot showing ROC curves for GNB classification with more and more features of the data, with appropriate axis labels and a legend. Use `xlim` between 0 and 0.01. Which feature seems to make the classification trivially easy? *Note: `predict_proba` returns an array with as many columns as classes. You've labeled quasars as $1$, so for the ROC curve you must make sure to access the relevant quasar probability-- you can find this by accessing the **classes_** attribute of the estimator.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Repeat (4) for Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Let's try classification with GMM Bayes. Restrict the training and testing to be just on the $4$ colors. Iterate now over number of components in the GMM Bayes fit up to $10$, plotting ROC curves for all, and find the number of components that gives the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Repeat (6) for $K$-nearest neighbor classification, looping over number of neighbors between 5 and 100 in steps of 10. Find the number that gives the best performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Repeat (6) for Decision Tree classification, looping over the maximum tree depth between 1 and 10. Find the number that gives the best performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Finally, plot the ROC curves for GNB, QDA, and the best-performing GMMBayes, KNN, and DT classification algorithms, all using just the 4 colors. What is the overall best-performing classifier? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Make a 2-panel plot, showing in the left panel the color-coded training data in $(u-g)$ versus $(g-r)$ (similar to item 2 above), and in the right panel the same features of the testing data color coded by their predicted class from the tuned best-performing classifier. "
